PHP Environment
---------------
- An environment is the machine were an application runs

- Generally, there are two (2) types of environments
    - Local Environment
        - Setup on your personal computer or local machine
        - Where you can write, test & run your code
        - Only accessible to the developer

        - Primarily used for developing and testing process
        - Provide the opportunity to break things without disrupting users of the application
        - Freely make changes / modifications before shipping the application to the real world

        - Luckily, the PHP community provided solutions to setup a Local Environment

    - Production Environment
        - It is a live environment where the application is deployed & running for users
        - Accessible to the real world
        - Not the place to test the application's code

        - Typically hosted on a remote server
